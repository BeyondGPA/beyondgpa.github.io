**Demo (EN) · INF8808 Project · Team #12 · BeyondGPA**

Hey everyone! My name’s Omar, and I’m honored proud to welcome you to the official demo of **BeyondGPA** — a data visualization project built for the INF8808 course at Polytechnique Montréal in the Winter 2025 semester.

This project was built by my amazing team consisting of the lovely Ireina, Sam the man, Felix the brains, the great Mohamed, and, of course myself — all under the guidance of our amazing Professor, Mister Thomas Hurtut.

But BeyondGPA is much more than just a school project!

I can hear you asking right now "So what is it?"

Well, at its core,

it’s a question I'm sure we’ve all asked ourselves as students:

 _“Do good grades actually matter?”_  

As a group of engingeering student, believe me, we suffer enough as it is! And so we're almost constently asking :

Are they worth the effort?

Do they actually lead to more job offers? Promotions? Career Satisfaction? 

Or, is there more to success than just your GPA?

To answer that, we found a very useful dataset of 10,000 student profiles — complete with academics, experiences, and career outcomes.
From there we designed and built a full story website using **Angular and D3.js** to explore the answer visually.

The journey starts on a space-themed landing page — because we’re not just crunching numbers, we’re going beyond.  
Beyond stats. Beyond GPAs. Beyond expectations.

Here we have a quick intro, a theme toggle between light and dark modes

Like any and all real devs, I always go dark mode but it's up to user preference!

and our "Start Exploring" button.

Once we hit it we float through to the core of our project:

This gets us here, to the main-page,

We have a lovely header with our name and slogan, as well as links, one to the about-page (with all the blabla I just covered), one to all of the source code hosted on github, and a Theme toggle like the one on the landing page!

**Visual 1**: GPA vs. Job Title  
We kick things off with a box plot that seeks to understand the impact of GPA on futur job titles

We can very clearly see a strong pattern: 

students with higher GPAs

tend to land higher job titles.  

It’s a quick win for GPA... but we let's not get carried away!

this is just the beginning

We immediately ask — is this about recognition or compensation?

**Visual 2**: GPA vs. Starting Salary  
Moving on to our second visual, or should I say visuals,

a series of scatter plots for our diffenrt majors,

from art to maths, we've got it all.

We can also change the academic indicator used for the visual,

Here we flip the script: higher grades do _not_ guarantee better pay. Salaries are surprisingly flat across academic tiers.  
So if grades don’t buy you gold, what does?

**Visual 3**: Projects & Networking vs. Job Offers  
Here’s the twist — a scatter plot that shows a strong correlation between real-world experience and job opportunities.  
You can _see_ it: more projects and better networking leads to more job offers, even for students with average GPAs.  
GPA might get your foot in the door… but skills and connections swing it wide open.

**Visual 4**: GPA vs. Time to Promotion  
So what about long-term growth? Back to GPA — and guess what? It’s back on top.  
Students with higher GPAs tend to be promoted faster and more consistently. So while grades don’t guarantee salary, they seem to offer _momentum_.

**Visual 5**: Demographic Fairness  
Lastly, although this project's core focus is academic indicators versus career sucess, we couldn't leave without exploring how age and gender shape early career outcomes.

Unfortunately, we can see the disparities are real — across salary, satisfaction, and work-life balance.  
Success looks different depending on who you are.

It’s a sobering but, necessary note to end on.

And that brings us to the big picture:

> "What really drives career success?"

To no one's surprise, I'm sure, it’s not one thing — it’s a mix. GPA, yes. But also experience, soft skills, and sometimes even luck or bias.  
This project isn’t just about answering a question — it’s about understanding the system behind it.

We’ve put a huge focus on design, theming, and user experience. Because data should be beautiful — and insight should be _felt_, not just read.

Thank you for joining me. I hope BeyondGPA gave you something to think about — and maybe even helped reframe what success really means.

If you’re watching this as part of the Data Viz evaluation — thank you for an amazing semester.  
If you’re just stumbling on this, I hope you learned something!

I'm Omar and this was **BeyondGPA**.  
Let’s redefine success — one pixel at a time.
