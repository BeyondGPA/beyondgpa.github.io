      <p>
        <strong>BeyondGPA</strong> is an interactive data storytelling project that challenges the assumption that academic excellence alone defines early career success.
        Through a series of visual explorations, the project reveals how GPA, soft skills, and demographics all play nuanced roles in shaping professional outcomes.
